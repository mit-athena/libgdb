	/*	This function is an analog of the standard Berkeley
	/*	select system call.  It provides all the functions
	/*	of select, but in addition, it awaits completion
	/*	of a specified list of queued gdb operations.  
	/*	
	/*	This function returns when any combination of the
	/*	following are found to be true:
	/*	
	/*	1) Any of the designated operations has completed
	/*	   or terminated prematurely.
	/*	
	/*	2) Activity is detected on any of the explictly supplied
	/*	   file descriptors or the supplied timer has expired.
	/*	
	/*	The count returned is only for file descriptors 
	/*	explicitly listed.  Completed operatons may be detected
	/*	by checking OP_STATUS for each of the operations in
	/*	the list.  File descriptors controlled by CONNECTIONS
	/*	should never be passed explictly in the bit maps to
	/*	this routine.  Only user controlled file descriptors 
	/*	may be explictly selected.
	/*	
	/*	Return code summary:
	/*		
	/*		-2	One or more listed operations completed.
	/*			Timer did not ring (as far as we could
	/*			tell), other fd's did not complete, or
	/*			we didn't get far enough to bother 
	/*			looking. (see fairness below.)
	/*	
	/*		-1      An error was returned on select of a 
	/*			user supplied socket.  errno has the
	/*			error code.
	/*	
	/*		0	The timer rang.  Some operations may
	/*			be complete, but it's unlikely.
	/*	
	/*		>0	This many user supplied fd's were
	/*			satisfied--same as for select.
	/*			Operations in the list may also have
	/*			completed.
	/*	
	/*	Fairness is not guaranteed.  This routine tends to
	/*	favor activity on CONNECTIONs.  In particular, if
	/*	some operation(s) in the list can be completed 
	/*	synchronously, a real select is never done to

	/*	explictly specified and (2) it allows transmission and
	/*	receipt to progress on all connections and (3) it considers
	/*	a connection to be selected iff a transmission operation
	/*	which had been pending becomes complete.  One may consider
	/*	that con_select turns the fd's controlled by sockets into
	/*	packet streams rather than byte streams.  Note also that
	/*	this operation differs from a traditional select and an
	/*	op_select in that it is not robust against waiting for
	/*	connections with pre-completed activity. This could be
	/*	added, but since it's an internal routine anyway, it seems
	/*	not to be worthwhile. Also, this routine presumes that all 
	/*	possible progress has been made before con_select is invoked.
	/*	
	/*	This operation hangs in a select.  If activity is
	/*	discovered on any of the sockets controlled by the database
	/*	library, then the corresponding input is read and
	/*	appropriate processing is done.  If any of the transmission
	/*	operations which had been pending on one of these
	/*	connections completes, then con_select may return.  In
	/*	fact, con_select attempts to complete any further
	/*	connection related activity which can be done without
	/*	blocking, but con_select never blocks AFTER a transmission
	/*	operation has gone complete.
	/*	
	/*	If activity is detected on any of the file descriptors
	/*	supplied by the user, then a count and bit fields are
	/*	returned just as for select. (Activity on database sockets
	/*	is never reflected in either count or bitfields.)  Timeout
	/*	causes a return, as with select.  Upon return, the program
	/*	must check for completion or termination on all of the
	/*	connections in which he/she is interested, for activity on
	/*	the selected file descriptors, and for timeouts, if
	/*	requested, since any or all of these may be reported
	/*	together.
	/*	
	/*	Return values for con_select: >0 same as for select, 0 time
	/*	expired, -1, error in select on user fd, -2, connections
	/*	have progressed but nothing else of interest.
