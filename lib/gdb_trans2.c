/*	This routine was introduced by Bill Sommerfeld after profiling 
/*	revealed that unnecessary attempts to progress on quiescent
/*	sockets were causing excessive overhead in the system.  I am
/*	still suspicious that this routine may be getting called in
/*	places where a full gdb_progress is needed.  e.g. I'm not
